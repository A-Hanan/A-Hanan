# Software Engineer | Full-Stack SaaS & AI Agent Architect 🚀

### Architecting High-Performance Systems & Intelligent Workflows

I am a **Senior Software Engineer with 5+ years of experience**, specializing in building production-grade SaaS and autonomous AI systems. Since late 2023, I have operated as a core engineer for multiple stealth startups, moving products from conceptual drafts to investor-ready platforms.

I specialize in the **"hard logic"** of modern web apps: distributed data systems, high-performance content orchestration, and agentic reasoning.

### 🧪 Technical Focus & Specialization

* **Agentic AI & LLM Orchestration:** Designing stateful, tool-using agents and RAG pipelines using **LangGraph, LangChain, and the Vercel AI SDK**.
* **Multi-Framework Expertise:** Expert in both **React/Next.js** and **Vue/Nuxt.js** ecosystems, choosing the right stack for scalability and developer velocity.
* **Content & Data Architecture:** High-performance content delivery using **Sanity.io and GROQ** for complex, structured data environments.
* **Database Design:** Architecting resilient data layers across Relational (**Postgres**) and NoSQL (**MongoDB, DynamoDB**) environments.
