Software Engineer | B2B SaaS & AI Agent Architect 🚀
Architecting Investor-Ready Systems & Agentic Workflows
I am a Senior Software Engineer with 5+ years of experience, specializing in the Next.js and Nest.js ecosystems. Since late 2023, I have operated as a core engineer for multiple stealth startups, moving complex products from conceptual drafts to production-grade platforms.

I don’t just write code—I architect systems that prioritize data integrity, multi-tenant isolation, and autonomous AI reasoning.

🧪 Technical Focus & Specialization
Agentic AI Orchestration: Building stateful, tool-using agents with Mastra, LangGraph, and the Vercel AI SDK. Specialized in high-efficiency RAG pipelines for complex data environments.

B2B SaaS Infrastructure: Implementing robust "hard logic"—Row Level Security (RLS), usage-based billing, and feature gating via Schematic.

Production Excellence: Bleeding-edge implementation of Next.js 16 and React 19 (Server Components, Actions, and optimized Streaming).

🛠️ The Tech Stack

🏗️ Current Shipments
🚀 Draxt AI: A 24/7 AI drafting engine for creators. Built on a parallelized processing pipeline that generates full production assets (scripts, SEO, thumbnails) in < 60 seconds.

🏢 Onplo: Architecting the frontend (Next.js) for a revolutionary "all-in-one" business platform, focusing on secure account and payment infrastructure.

🔒 Stealth Startup (NDA): Developing a RAG-powered financial analysis tool with strict data isolation and automated calculation engines.

📊 GitHub Stats
🤝 Let's Collaborate
I am at my best when solving high-stakes architectural hurdles or performance bottlenecks. If you are building a startup and need a technical partner to help you cross the finish line:

Portfolio: abdulhanan.services

LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/abdul-hanan

Email: a.hanan.official@gmail.com

How to make this pop on your profile:
Use a Transparent Theme: I've set the badges and stats to theme=transparent so they blend into GitHub’s Dark/Light modes.

Hyper-Focus on "Agent Architect": By grouping Mastra, LangGraph, and Inngest together, you look like a specialized expert, not a generalist.

The "Draxt" Mention: It proves you are an active builder of your own products, which founders love.

Would you like me to help you create a specific "Featured Repositories" list that highlights the technical complexity of Draxt or your RAG implementations?
